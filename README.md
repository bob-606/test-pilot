# Mechanic → Pilot: Full Roadmap

*(Training & exams in **Portugal/Cyprus**; Part‑66 licence application via **Estonia**)*

---

## Snapshot

* **Goal A:** EASA **Part‑66 Category C** (maintenance certifying engineer).
* **Goal B:** **Pilot track** toward airline employment; optional **FI** for hour-building; long‑term **Flight Test Engineer / Test Pilot**.
* **Where:** Training & exams in **Portugal/Cyprus**.
* **Licence authority:** Apply to **Estonian CAA** for Part‑66 issuance.

## A) EASA Part‑66 Category C — concise plan

### Core requirements (what you must show)

* **Education:** Bachelor’s degree in a technical field (validated by the training‑state authority).
* **Experience:** **3 years** civil aircraft maintenance, incl. **6 months observing base maintenance**.
* **EU experience:** **12 months** in an **EASA Part‑145** organisation (EU‑based experience for non‑EU candidates).
* **Exams:** Pass **Part‑66 modules**; claim exemptions where your degree overlaps.

### Do this next (in order)

1. **Validate your degree** with the competent authority where you will train (**Portugal** or **Cyprus**).
2. **Join a Part‑145 organisation** in the EU (e.g., in Portugal) and start logging experience; ensure the **6‑month base‑maintenance** observation is documented.
3. **Complete Part‑147 training & sit Part‑66 exams** in **Portugal/Cyprus**; use module exemptions as applicable.
4. **Assemble evidence**: logbook extracts, employer letters (duties & durations), course certificates, and exam passes.
5. **Apply for Part‑66 Cat C** with the **Estonian CAA** (include all evidence and exemption confirmations).

### Evidence checklist (attach to the Estonian application)

* Degree + transcript + **validation/recognition** from PT/CY authority.
* **Experience log** with **3 years** total and **6 months** base‑maintenance observation highlighted.
* **12 months** EU **Part‑145** employment letter(s).
* **Part‑147** course certificates + **Part‑66** exam result sheets.
* ID/residency as required by the Estonian CAA.

### Timing & notes

* Practical experience is the long pole; **expect \~3–5 years** end‑to‑end depending on hiring and base‑maintenance access.
* Keep a contemporaneous **task‑based logbook** to avoid re‑work at application time.
* Consider Portuguese ATOs/centres for convenience; keep all documentation bilingual where possible.

## B) Pilot track — compact plan (PT/CY focus)

1. **PPL** at an ATO in **Portugal/Cyprus**.
2. **ATPL theory (distance)** alongside flying.
3. **Hour building** locally where possible.
4. **CPL + IR/ME**; then **FI** *(optional)* to build hours faster.
5. **Apply to airlines** (e.g., Luxair/Cargolux) once competitive.

**Optional booster:** **FI(S) glider** (cost‑efficient experience): SPL theory/practicum → FI theory → FI practicum with **200 PIC launches**.

---

## C) Long‑term: Flight Test Engineer / Test Pilot

* **Typical entry:** **CPL/ATPL**, **\~1,000–1,500+ hours**, graduation from an accredited test‑pilot school (e.g., ETPS/NTPS/EPNER).
* **Bridge role:** **Flight Test Engineer (FTE)** leverages your engineering + Part‑66 background; consider dedicated FTE/test programmes after building flight time.

### Versioning

* **Assumptions set by you:** Training & exams in **Portugal/Cyprus**; Part‑66 application via **Estonia**.
* This doc merges your latest notes into a single two‑path roadmap you can print or share.
