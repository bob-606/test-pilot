# EASA Part-66 Category C vs. Test Pilot Career Path  

## 🛠️ **Part-66 Category C (Maintenance Certifying Engineer)**  
**Goal**: Certify aircraft as safe after **base maintenance**.  
**Your Path**:  
- ✅ **Relevant**: Your engineering degree + Part-66 licence qualifies you for **technical roles** (avionics, systems troubleshooting).  
- ❌ **Not Directly Linked to Test Pilot**: Focuses on maintenance, not flying.  

---

## ✈️ **Test Pilot Requirements**  
### **1. Core Qualifications**  
| Requirement               | Details                                                                 |  
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Pilot Licence**         | Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL) or Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL). |  
| **Flight Hours**          | 1,000–1,500+ hours (varies by school/program).                         |  
| **Test Pilot School**     | Graduation from an accredited program (e.g., **ETPS**, **NTPS**, **USAF TPS**). |  
| **Technical Background**  | Engineering degree (yours is **advantageous** for flight test engineering roles). |  

### **2. How Part-66 Helps Indirectly**  
- **Technical Expertise**: Deep aircraft systems knowledge (avionics, engines) is valuable for **flight test engineering** roles.  
- **Career Transition**: Work in aircraft development/maintenance → network with flight test teams.  

---

## 🚀 **Direct Path to Test Pilot (For You)**  
1. **Obtain Pilot Licences**:  
   - Start with Private Pilot Licence (PPL) → Commercial Pilot Licence (CPL).  
   - Cost: €50,000–€100,000 (Europe).  
2. **Build Flight Hours**:  
   - Work as a flight instructor, charter pilot, or in commercial aviation.  
3. **Attend Test Pilot School**:  
   - Programs: 1–2 years (e.g., **ETPS UK**, **EPNER France**).  
   - Competitive entry (requires CPL + engineering/math background).

## 🔄 **Alternative: Flight Test Engineer**  
- **Role**: Analyze data, design tests, work alongside test pilots (no flying required).  
- **Your Advantage**:  
  - Part-66 + engineering degree qualifies you.  
  - Pursue certifications like **EASA Flight Test Engineer Licence**.  
- **Path**:  
  1. Gain experience in aircraft development/Part-145.  
  2. Apply to flight test engineering programs (e.g., **Cranfield University UK**).  

---

## ✅ **Recommendation**  
- **Short-Term**: Complete Part-66 Category C for stable aviation engineering work.  
- **Long-Term (Test Pilot)**:  
  - Start pilot training **now** (even part-time).  
  - Target hybrid roles (e.g., **flight test engineer**) to blend your engineering skills with flight testing.
