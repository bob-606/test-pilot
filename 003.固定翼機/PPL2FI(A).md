# Based on this, a pathway to FI(A)

Based on PPL with ATPL theory exams completed, here is the complete pathway to obtaining an EASA FI(A) certificate.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

### Prerequisites to Verify

Before starting the FI(A) course, ensure the following minimum requirements are met:[^3][^4][^5][^1]

- Minimum age of 18 years.[^5][^6]
- Hold valid EASA Medical Class 1 or Class 2.[^6]
- PPL(A) license with completed ATPL theory exams (satisfies CPL theoretical knowledge requirement).[^4][^1]
- 200 hours total flight time on aeroplanes or TMGs, with at least 150 hours as pilot-in-command.[^1][^4][^5]
- 30 hours on single-engine piston aeroplanes, with at least 5 hours within 6 months before pre-entry test.[^3][^4][^1]
- 10 hours instrument flight instruction (maximum 5 hours in simulator).[^4][^1][^3]
- 20 hours VFR cross-country as PIC, including one flight of at least 540 km with full-stop landings at two different aerodromes.[^1][^3][^4]
- ICAO English Language Proficiency Level 4 or higher.[^2]


### Step-by-Step Pathway

**Step 1: Pre-Entry Flight Assessment**
Complete a pre-entry flight test with a qualified FI instructor within 6 months before starting the course. This assessment is based on the proficiency check for class and type ratings and evaluates readiness for the FI training course.[^7][^4][^1]

**Step 2: Enroll at EASA-Approved Training Organization**
Select an approved ATO offering FI(A) courses. The course must be completed at an ATO to ensure regulatory compliance.[^2][^3][^4]

**Step 3: Complete Theoretical Knowledge Training**
Undertake 125 hours of ground instruction (100 hours theoretical knowledge plus 25 hours teaching and learning). Topics include instructional techniques, human performance, learning psychology, threat and error management, and technical subject refresher.[^8][^2][^3][^1]

**Step 4: Complete Flight Training**
Complete 30 hours of flight instruction, of which 25 hours must be dual instruction with a qualified FI instructor. Up to 5 hours may be conducted in an approved simulator. Training focuses on right-seat flying, demonstration techniques, student error management, and instructional briefings.[^2][^3][^4][^1]

**Step 5: Assessment of Competence**
Pass the final skill test with an EASA examiner, demonstrating both flying proficiency and instructional ability. The assessment includes pre-flight briefings, teaching demonstrations, and evaluation of instructional competencies.[^3][^2]

**Step 6: Certificate Issued with Restricted Privileges**
Upon successful completion, receive FI(A) certificate with restricted privileges FI(A)(R). Restrictions are removed after supervising students to first solo and demonstrating instructional competency.[^9][^7]

### Timeline Estimate

The typical FI(A) course duration is 2-3 months for full-time students, or 3-6 months for part-time students. Accelerated programs may complete training in 4-8 weeks with intensive daily schedules.[^10][^5][^4][^2]
