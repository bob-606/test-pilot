**Feasibility & Requirements (AY2025 Version)**  

---

## **1. Experience Validity**  
- **Portugal-Based Experience**:  
  - **Acceptable** if gained at a **Part-145 organization** (EASA-approved)[1][5].  
  - **Must include**:  
    - 3 years of **base/line maintenance** (B1/B2/C tasks).  
    - Logbook entries signed by **Portuguese Part-66 certifying staff**[1][3].  

- **Traficom Recognition**:  
  - Finnish authorities accept **EASA-wide experience** but require **6 months of recent activity** (within the last year)[4].

## **2. Finnish Personal Identity Code**  
### **Post-Experience Steps**  
1. **Secure Finnish Employment/Residency**:  
   - Work for a **Finnish Part-145 organization** (e.g., Finnair Technical Services).  
   - Obtain a **residence permit** (via employment, study, or family ties)[2].  
2. **Register with DVV**:  
   - Submit proof of residency/employment to the **Digital and Population Data Services Agency**.  
   - Receive your **personal identity code** (1–2 weeks processing)[2].

## **3. Application to Traficom**  
### **Required Documentation**  
- **EASA Form 19** with:  
  - Portuguese experience logbook (Part-145 tasks, supervisor signatures)[3][5].  
  - Degree certificates (electronic/electrical engineering).  
  - Proof of Finnish residency/employment.  
- **Fee**: €500–€700 (Traficom processing)[4].  

### **Key Considerations**  
- **Recent Experience**: Ensure 6 months of maintenance work within the **last year** before applying[4].

## **4. Risks & Mitigation**  
| Risk                                  | Mitigation Strategy                 |  
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| **Delayed Finnish employment**        | Apply to Finnish MROs while in Portugal (e.g., Nordic Aviation Group). |  
| **Degree not recognized**             | Validate through a **Finnish Part-147 school** (e.g., Insinöörioppilaitos)[1]. |  
| **Experience deemed outdated**        | Take a **short-term contract** in Finland before applying. |

**Final Verdict**: This pathway is **viable** if you:  
1. Work under a **Portuguese Part-145 organization**.  
2. Transition to Finland via employment/residency.  
3. Ensure experience meets Traficom’s recency criteria.
