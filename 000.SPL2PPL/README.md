# Zero to FI(S): Master Plan

**Goal:** EASA Flight Instructor (Sailplane) with TMG privileges by October 2026.

**Why FI(S)?** Bypass €50k PPL/CPL system. Part-SFCL allows paid instruction with only SPL + 100 hours + 200 launches.

---

## 1. The Strategy

**Geographic Split:**
- **Estonia (May):** Finish SPL license.
- **Hungary (June–October):** TMG rating, hour building, FI(S) course.

**Cost/Timeline Trade-off:**
- Pay for **30 hours TMG** (reliable, weather-independent).
- Chase **70 hours on gliders** (cheap, weather-dependent).
- Result: €9,740 | 6 months.

## 2. The Timeline

### May 2026: SPL Issue (Estonia)
**Kuusiku Lennuklubi**
- Finish final flights (~50 hours accumulated).

### June 2026: TMG Rating (Hungary)
**Malév Aero Club or Matkópuszta**
- 6 hours dual flight training (TMG-specific systems).
- Skill test (90 min).
- **Outcome:** TMG class rating endorsed on SPL.

### July 2026: TMG Hour Building (Part 1)
**Malév Aero Club, Hungary**
- Fly 15 hours cross-country TMG as PIC.
- Long-distance navigation practice.
- **Outcome:** 15 hours logged, 15 launches recorded.

### August 2026: Mixed Hour Building
**Hungarian gliding clubs, Hungary**
- **Weekdays (Good Weather):** Thermal soaring in pure gliders.
  - Target: 40 hours over 20 days (3–5 hour flights).
  - Cost: €50/flight (€8 winch + €15/hr rental).
  
- **Weekends (Any Weather):** Winch launch spam.
  - Target: 100 launches over 2–3 weekends.
  - Cost: €10/launch.

- **Mid-August:** Finish remaining 15 TMG hours (Part 2 of the 30-hour mandatory block).

### September 2026: FI(S) Course
**Hungarian ATO, Hungary**
- **Week 1:** Ground school (instructional techniques, advanced meteorology, FI responsibilities).
- **Week 2–3:** Flight training (6–9 hours dual) + skill test.
- **Outcome:** FI(S) certificate issued.

### October 2026: Job Search / Buffer
**Spain**
- Begin contacting Spanish gliding clubs.
- Visit in person (Ocaña, Igualada, Santa Cilia, Benimantell).
- Negotiate first instructor role.

## 3. Daily Operating Rhythm (July–August)

### Thermal Day (Weekday, High Pressure)
- **05:00:** Arrive at airfield.
- **06:30:** First tow/winch.
- **07:00–11:00:** Soar using thermal lift (target 3–5 hours).
- **12:00–14:00:** Lunch.
- **14:30:** Second tow.
- **15:00–18:00:** Second soaring flight.
- **18:00–19:00:** Debrief, logging, cleanup.
- **Result:** 6–8 hours flight, 2 launches, €50–60 cost.

### Winch Day (Weekend, Any Weather)
- **08:00–17:00:** Continuous operations.
- **Goal:** 10–15 launches/day (50 launches/day x 2 days).
- **Pattern:** Winch launch → 15–20 min flight → land → repeat.
- **Result:** 100 launches over 3 weekends, €1,000 cost.

### TMG Cross-Country (July/August, Any Weather)
- **Typical flight:** 2–3 hours, €230–345 cost.
- **Navigation focus:** Cross-wind planning, fuel management, diversion options.
- **Frequency:** 2 flights/week.

## 5. Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bad August weather** | Medium | Thermal hours fail | Extend timeline to October (have buffer) |
| **TMG unavailable July** | Low | Cannot get mandatory hours | Book 4 months in advance (April 2026) |
| **SPL checkride failure** | Low | Miss June TMG slot | Reschedule test immediately; most pass within 2 attempts |
| **FI(S) course fully booked** | Low | Delay to November | Confirm seats in April 2026 |
| **Injury/Illness** | Low | Cannot fly 6 weeks+ | Build 1-month buffer into timeline |
| **Cash shortfall** | Medium | Stop flying mid-stream | You have €1,310 buffer; use if needed |

## 6. First Job (Post-FI(S))

### Target: Spanish Gliding Clubs

**Where:**
- Aeroclub de Ocaña (Madrid, massive thermals).
- Aerodrom de Igualada-Odena (Barcelona).
- Santa Cilia (Pyrenees, world-class).
- Benimantell (Mallorca, year-round).

**How:**
1. Email 5–10 clubs (Oct 2026) with logbook + license copy.
2. Visit in person (Oct–Nov 2026).
3. Negotiate terms (weekends, seasonal, part-time).

**Typical First Role:**
- **Pay:** €25–€35/flight hour.
- **Frequency:** Weekends + summer months.
- **First Year:** €5k–€10k part-time income.

**Competitive Edge:** You have 500+ hours of glider time by Oct 2026 (from the training itself). Most rookie instructors have zero. You are a **valuable asset**.
