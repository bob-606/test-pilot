| **5. PPL(A) SEP** | Total flight time | 45 hrs (TMG hours count)  [easa.europa](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/general-aviation/licensing-general-aviation) |

| | **Final status** | Can tow with both TMG and SEP  [motorglide.co](https://www.motorglide.co.uk/glider-pilots/sailplane-towing-rating) |

**Advantages of this sequence:** TMG hours credit toward PPL, you can start towing earlier with TMG, then upgrade to tow with standard tugs (Piper Pawnee, Cessna, etc.). [caa.co](https://www.caa.co.uk/commercial-industry/pilot-licences/aeroplanes/touring-motor-glider-rating-requirements/)

### 0 to PPL

| Phase | Location | Activity | Est. Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Theory** | **Estonia** | Pass all 9 SPL exams at Transpordiamet (Tallinn). | ~€100 |
| **2. SPL License** | **Estonia (Kuusiku)** | Join Tallinn Aeroclub. Fly weekends (May–Sept). Get SPL. | ~€2,000 |
| **3. TMG Hours** | **Hungary (Malév)** | Fly 24 hours PIC on Falke SF-25 (Oct/Nov). | ~€2,400 |
| **4. PPL Theory** | **Estonia** | Pass 5 powered exams at Transpordiamet. | ~€60 |
| **5. PPL Conversion**| **Hungary (Malév)** | 15-hour course + Skill Test on Cessna 150/TMG. | ~€2,800 |
| **6. Issue License** | **Estonia** | Submit Hungarian flight docs to Estonian CAA. | ~€50 |
| **TOTAL** | | **0 to PPL(A)** | **~€7,410** |

### **Why this works**
*   **Cheapest Flying:** You use cheap winch launches in Estonia and cheap club rates in Hungary.
*   **Best Logistics:** No "lost" travel time. You fly where you are (summer in Estonia, autumn in Budapest).
*   **Simple Paperwork:** Estonia is your "State of License Issue," holding your medical and exam records. Hungary just provides the training certificate.

### **Critical Next Steps**
1.  **Email Malév Aero Club:** Confirm the hourly rental rate for their **SF-25 Falke** for club members.
2.  **Email Tallinna Aeroklubi:** Sign up for the spring SPL course at Kuusiku.
3.  **Start Studying:** Buy EASA SPL theory books now and aim to pass exams by April.
